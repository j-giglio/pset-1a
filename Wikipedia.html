				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. As for its user friendliness, there are no real flaws to be found for viewers. Every aspect of the site works as is expected of a wiki. Furthermore, the information presented by the editors tends to be accurate, having a source linked at the bottom of the page. For editors, making an edit is simple and no account is needed unless the page is protected. Protections are put on pages that are considered to be prone to vandalization. Although they may be inconvenient to some people, protections are a necessary feature on the site.</p>
				<p>The community on the site is spectacular, consisting of numerous dedicated “Wikipedians” committed to keeping objective truth the only focus of the site. All users are required to follow carefully written out guides such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style>this one</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette>this one</a> to not only prevent the articles from becoming a mess of different writing styles and opinions, but also to keep fights from breaking out on discussion pages.</p>
				<p>As for its appearance, Wikipedia’s utilitarian design reflects the purpose of the site, to bring readers facts, no more and no less. 12-point default font on a white background is chosen over unnecessary frills and ribbons.</p>
