		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>YouTube is a free online video-sharing platform. Although in general its user friendliness is decent, it is widely known for one problem: its recommendation algorithm. The algorithm is designed to recommend videos to viewers based not only on the type of video, but also on how often the creators upload, more frequent uploaders will be recommended more often than those who do not. This results in a terrible amount of work necessary for creators who cannot create videos as often as others.</p>
		<p>Consistent with many other sites that use a white background such as Reddit, dark mode looks significantly better than the default mode. It makes you wonder why dark isn’t the default mode. Moving past dark and light mode, YouTube is otherwise set up well and professionally, and there is not much room for criticism.</p>
		<p>Its community is highly varied because anyone can upload to it, so you will see DIY tutorials, let’s plays, music videos, and everything in between. The comments on videos are infamous for being places where immature people gather and bicker with one another, so staying away from those is recommended.</p>
