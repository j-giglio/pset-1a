		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>UCVTS.org is the official site of the UCVTS school district. The site contains useful information about the district including a link to PowerSchool, a link to the school webmail, a way to apply to the school, a lunch schedule, a schedule for school events, and a staff directory. The main page also contains links to the official pages of the different programs the district offers. All in all, the site is put together in a pretty easy to navigate, intuitive way drastically improving upon the old site in these regards.</p>
		<p> Visually, the main issue with the site is the front page. As soon as the viewer opens the page, they see a huge slideshow that takes up the entire screen. Upon scrolling down, you will see that the images and links are crowded together. If these were spaced out a little more, the site would be significantly easier to look at.</p>
